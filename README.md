# Music-Genre-Classification
Project classifies audio clips into 10 music genres (GTZAN dataset) using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). It employs Librosa to extract Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs) as features, achieving over 71% accuracy. The prediction script allows classification of new, unseen audio files.
